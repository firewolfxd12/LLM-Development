- Inference time - the duration it takes for a trained machine learning or deep learning model to make a prediction or generate an output based on new, unseen data.
- Reasoning exemplars- are examples or demonstrations of reasoning processes used to solve problems, make decisions, or understand complex concepts. These exemplars are often used in educational settings to illustrate how to think through a problem step-by-step, providing a model for learners to emulate.
- Supervised learning - is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. This means that each training example in the dataset is paired with an output label. The goal of the model is to learn the mapping from inputs to outputs so that it can predict the output for new, unseen inputs.
- Zero-shot learning (ZSL) - is a type of machine learning technique where a model is trained to recognize objects or perform tasks without having seen any examples of those objects or tasks during the training phase. Instead, the model leverages auxiliary information, such as semantic attributes or descriptions, to make predictions about new, unseen classes. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where it is impractical or impossible to collect training data for every possible class or task.
- Temporal Difference (TD) Learning - is a central algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL) that combines ideas from dynamic programming and Monte Carlo methods. It is particularly useful for learning the value of a policy by bootstrapping, meaning it updates estimates based partly on other learned estimates without waiting for a final outcome.
- Reinforcement learning (RL) - is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative reward. This learning paradigm is inspired by behavioral psychology and is distinct from supervised and unsupervised learning.
